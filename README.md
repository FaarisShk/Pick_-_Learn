A Digital Signage Product designed while working at DesertSign Trading LLC. Pick and Learn is an interactive product where any consumer product will be placed on a desk at any shop. When a customer picks up the product, the adverstisement video associated with the product will start playing on the display screen. This module is based on Arduino UNO, Unity3D and C#. This was possible through interfacing IR sensors with Arduino Uno and placing them at appropriate positions on the desk where the products are to be placed. The products will be placed on the desk in such a way that they block the Infrared signal sent by the IR sensor. When the product is picked up and the Infrared signal is no longer blocked, it will send a resoponse to the Arduino Microcontroller. The Arduino Microcontroller will then communicate with the Unity3D scene and C# Script and play the video according to the product.
